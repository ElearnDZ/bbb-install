# bbb-install

Install BigBlueButton 1.0 using the instructions at http://docs.bigbluebutton.org/install/install.html, and optionally install the development environment and tools.

This is an interactive installation.  You cannot leave it unattended.

The installation process changes for each major release of BBB, so these scripts will require updating for BBB 1.1.
